# XMLTV-Provider

Goal exploit the fact that Github offers cron jobs. With this we can run a service everyday that pulls data from a provider and converts it into an xml tv epg file.
With GH pages we can output the results of the action to a publically accessible place :-)

# Usage:

No need to do anything codewise, just point your app of choice the GH-pages site for the specific xml tv guide.
These guides are refreshed every day a 1 a.m. est covering the next 3 days.
